# Collatz-Conjecture
Visualize Collatz's Conjecture on a scatter plot starting from any N as it decomposes to one. 

Collatz's Conjecture is as follows: 
- Take any natural number n
  - If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2
  - If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1
- Repeat the process

The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1. 
The interesting part is that though the conjecture's rules are simple, it is exceptionally hard to prove mathematically. 
In fact, the conjecture has plenty of experimental evidence but has never been proven for the general case.
